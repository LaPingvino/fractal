  <description>
    <p>
      Fractal is a Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust. Its interface is optimized for
      collaboration in large groups, such as free software projects, and will fit all screens, big or small.
    </p>
    <p>Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find rooms to discuss your favorite topics, or talk privately to people, securely thanks to end-to-end encryption</li>
      <li>Send rich formatted messages, files, or your current location</li>
      <li>Reply to specific messages, react with emoji, mention users or rooms, edit or remove messages</li>
      <li>View images, and play audio and video directly in the conversation</li>
      <li>See who has read messages, and who is typing</li>
      <li>Log into multiple accounts at once (with Single-Sign On support)</li>
    </ul>

        <p>
          Due to a pesky bug that makes Fractal crash when our users attempt to start a
          verification, we are releasing Fractal 11.1 only 2 weeks after Fractal 11. And while we’re
          at it we also backported a few fixes for smaller paper cuts!

            A new version of Fractal numbered Eleven? Stranger things have happened… Features come
            running up that hill:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Support for login using the OAuth 2.0 API (as used by matrix.org, which recently made
            the switch to Matrix Authentication Service)
          </li>
          <li>
            Overhaul of the page that lists user sessions, with details moved to subpages, for a
            less cluttered feel, and allowing to rename sessions!
          </li>
          <li>
            Rearranged account settings, with a new Safety tab that includes a setting to toggle
            media preview visibility
          </li>
          <li>
            BlurHashes for images and videos, that are used as placeholders while the media is
            loading or if the preview is disabled
          </li>
          <li>
            Contiguous state events are grouped behind a single item
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As usual, this release includes other improvements and fixes thanks to all our
          contributors, and our upstream projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to address special thanks to the translators who worked on this version. We know

    <release version="10.1" type="stable" date="2025-02-10">
      <description>
        <p>
          Due to a couple of unfortunate but important regressions in Fractal 10, we are releasing
          Fractal 10.1 so our users don’t have to wait too long for them to be addressed. This minor
          version fixes the following issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some rooms were stuck in an unread state, even after reading them or marking them as
            read.
          </li>
          <li>
            Joining or creating a room would crash the app.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="10" type="stable" date="2025-01-30">
      <description>
        <p>
          How are you going to find your friends and coordinate end of day drinks when you’re lost
          in the middle of a large crowd in a big city? With the new version of your favorite Matrix
          client, of course! Here is Fractal 10.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The QR code scanning code has been ported to libaperture, the library behind GNOME
            Camera. This should result in better performance and more reliability.
          </li>
          <li>
            OAuth 2.0 compatibility was added, to make sure that we are ready for the upcoming
            authentication changes for matrix.org.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pills for users and rooms mentions show consistently in the right place instead of
            seemingly random places, getting rid of one of our oldest and most annoying bug.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attachments go through the send queue, ensuring correct order of all messages and
            improving the visual feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Videos were often not playing after loading in the room history. This was fixed, and we
            also show properly when an error occurred.
          </li>
          <li>
            We were downloading too many different sizes for avatar images, which would fill the
            media cache needlessly. We now only download a couple of sizes. This has the extra
            benefit of fixing blurry or missing thumbnails in notifications.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As usual, this release includes other improvements and fixes thanks to all our

        <p>
          What’s that behind you⁉️ 😱 Oh, that’s a new Fractal release❣️ 😁 🎃
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We switched to the glycin library (the same one used by GNOME Image Viewer) to load
            images, allowing us to fix several issues, like supporting more animated formats and
            SVGs and respecting EXIF orientation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The annoying bug where some rooms would stay as unread even after opening them is now a
            distant memory.
          </li>
          <li>
            The media cache uses its own database that you can delete if you want to free some space
            on your system. It will also soon be able to clean up unused media files to prevent it
            from growing indefinitely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes the day separators would show up with the wrong date, not anymore!
          </li>
          <li>
            We migrated to the new GTK 4.16 and libadwaita 1.6 APIs, including CSS variables,
            AdwButtonRow and AdwSpinner.
          </li>
          <li>
            We used to only rely on the secrets provider to tell us which Matrix accounts are
            logged-in, which caused issues for people sharing their secrets between devices. Now we
            also make sure that there is a data folder for a given session before trying to restore
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our notifications are categorized as coming from an instant messenger, so graphical
            shells that support it, such as Phosh, can play a sound for them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some room settings are hidden for direct chats, because it does not make sense to change
            them in this type of room.
          </li>
          <li>
            The size of the headerbar would change depending on whether the room has a topic or not.
            This will not happen anymore.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As usual, this release includes other improvements and fixes thanks to all our
          contributors, and our upstream projects.

    <release version="7" type="stable" date="2024-05-02">
      <description>
        <p>
          Here comes Fractal 7, with extended encryption support and improved accessibility.
          Server-side key backup and account recovery have been added, bringing greater security.
          Third-party verification has received some bug fixes and improvements. Amongst the many
          accessibility improvements, navigability has increased, especially in the room history.
          But that’s not all we’ve been up to in the past three months:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Messages that failed to send can now be retried or discarded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Messages can be reported to server admins for moderation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Room details are now considered complete, with the addition of room address management,
            permissions, and room upgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new member menu appears when clicking on an avatar in the room history. It offers a
            quick way to do many actions related to that person, including opening a direct chat
            with them and moderating them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pills are clickable and allow to directly go to a room or member profile.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <release version="6" type="stable" date="2024-01-18">
      <description>
        <p>
          Barely 2 months after Fractal 5, we feel there have been enough improvements to grant a
          new stable release. You have probably noticed that we have adopted a version scheme
          similar to GNOME and will bump the major version with each new release.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of goodies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fractal can open Matrix URIs, it is even registered as a handler for the “matrix”
            scheme
          </li>
          <li>
            The verification flow was rewritten, hopefully solving most verification issues
          </li>
          <li>
            Room members can be kicked, banned or ignored from their profile
          </li>
          <li>
            More notifications settings, global or per-room, were added
          </li>
          <li>
            Times follow the format (12h or 24h) from the system settings
          </li>
          <li>
            Tab auto-completion also works for mentioning public rooms, just start your query with
            “#”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This version is fully translated into 6 languages 🙌️ and we hope to get even more 📈 for
          the next one! Head over to Damned Lies if you want to give a hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would also like to thank our new and returning contributors and our upstream projects.

        <p>
          Fractal 5 is a full rewrite compared to Fractal 4, that now leverages GTK 4, libadwaita,
          and the Matrix Rust SDK. The two-and-a-half-year effort brings a new interface that fits
          all screens, big 🖥️ or small 📱, but should still look familiar to users of earlier versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It still offers the same old features you know and love, with a few additions.
          Highlights (<em>italics</em> is new✨ in 5):

        <ul>
          <li>Find rooms to discuss your favorite topics, or talk privately to people, securely thanks to <em>end-to-end encryption</em></li>
          <li>Send rich formatted messages, files, or <em>your current location</em></li>
